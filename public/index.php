<p>Hello! My name is Eric Ehmann, and I am philantrhopist turned developer.  I have founded a theater program for at-risk-youth in Hawaii, trained people in leadership and public speaking, inspired people to become clean, empowered people to finish marathons, and have raised over $10K for cancer research.  The secret to improving lives, is to meet people where they are and understand how they think, to create better solutions.  Therefore, I look for how to use this ambition to create wesbites and web applications, and this is where people spend a large portion of their lives.  Below is a sample of my work.</p>
